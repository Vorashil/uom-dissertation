\section{Combinatorial Preliminaries and Growth Function}

In this section we are going to introduce the basic combinatorial tools that provides the basis for our discussion including the concept of shattering, growth function of a family of subsets. The main aim of this section is to prove a theorem, which is referred as combomatorial dichotomy that characterises the growth function of a family of subsets.
