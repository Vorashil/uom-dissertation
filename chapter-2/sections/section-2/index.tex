\section{Non-independence property}

In this section, we build on the notions introduced earlier—specifically, \textit{shattering} and the \textit{growth function}—to formalise the Non-Independence Property (NIP) for families of sets. Our exposition follows~\cite[Chap.~5]{vandenDries1998}. We begin by defining the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a family of sets in terms of shattering. We then show that, when the VC-dimension is finite, this property admits an equivalent characterisation via a model-theoretic notion of \textit{dependence}. These dual perspectives on finite VC-dimension will serve as the foundation for the main result of this section: informally, that if a collection of subsets is dependent in lower dimensions, then this dependence persists in higher dimensions.
