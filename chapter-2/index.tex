\chapter{Non-Independence Property of O-minimal structures}\label{ch:nip-property}

We follow the presentation of~\cite[Chap.~5]{vandenDries1998} to develop a general combinatorial framework that will later be applied to o-minimal structures. The central aim is to show that every definable family in an o-minimal structure satisfies a strong restriction on the number of distinct subsets it can induce on finite sets: there exists a fixed exponent $d$ such that, for all sufficiently large finite sets $F$, the number of subsets of $F$ "shattered" by the family grows at most like $|F|^{d}$, rather than exponentially. Most of the chapter proceeds in a general setting, introducing the basic combinatorial notions of families of subsets and their growth functions, and proving a sharp dichotomyâ€”either the family generates exponentially many subsets, or its growth is bounded by a polynomial. A key tool is the duality between a family of sets and its parameter space, allowing us to transfer growth bounds between the two. This dual perspective connects naturally to a model-theoretic tameness condition, the non-independence property (NIP). In the final part, we specialise these general results to the o-minimal setting and prove that every definable family is NIP. Beyond its intrinsic interest, this fact will serve as a crucial ingredient in the learning-theoretic framework developed in a later chapter.
